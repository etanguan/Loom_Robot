![Automated Loom and the Team](/media/team_photo.jpg)

## Overview
For the 1A Mechatronics Engineering project, Liam Dachner, Ethan Guan, Josh Stadnyk, and Alanna Rudolph decided to create an automatic loom. The objective was to have a robot that could manufacture something tangible, like a bracelet or a scarf. The loom robot is built 
completely out of LEGO and 3D-printed parts. The robot uses 4 motors, one to flip the heddles, one to pull the fork, and two to pass the shuttle. The robot weaves with 10 warp threads and a user-specified number of weft threads. More information can be found in the report.
